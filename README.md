# CKB: CodeKataBattle 
This project has been developed as final assignment for the Software Engineering II course held by Professor Matteo Giovanni Rossi at Politecnico di Milano A.Y. 2023-2024. 

The objective of this project is to apply in practice what we learned during lectures to become familiar with software engineering practices and be able to address new software engineering issues rigorously. The project is divided into two assignments:

&nbsp; 1. The definition of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD), starting from an informal description of the problem.  
&nbsp; 2. The definition of the Design Document (DD) of the system considered in the previous point.

# Project Specification
CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a platform designed to help students improve their software development skills by training with peers on code kata. Educators use the platform to challenge students by creating code battles in which teams of students can compete against each other, improving their skills.  

The full specification can be found [here](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/CodeKataBattle-SE2-Project-2023/blob/main/Assignment%20RDD%20AY%202023-2024.pdf).
